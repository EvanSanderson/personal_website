    <h3> Week 1, General Assembly, 7.29.16 <h3>
    <hr>
    <p> I'm currently half way through my first week of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. So far, we've covered the basics of Git, Github, Atom, and CSS. I'm discovering the love/hate relationship with CSS which I'm
      sure all developers have - our instructor (Andy) showed us this GIF which I think sums up my general relationship with these aggravating style sheets: </p> <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X6peGqFZFZ0/UcTqFQ2O21I/AAAAAAAAPi0/uRJyfIgg9uo/s1600/blindssuck.gif" id = "peter">
      <p> In all honesty, I can say that I've learned more in the last 3 days than in the last 2 weeks, and that I know more now than I did a week ago. And that's a victory in my book. We also had a great panel with three professional developers. They talked about the industry,
        what it's like to be a developer, and left us with a great concept:
        if you don't feel somewhat over your head when you first start a job, you probably took the wrong job. </p>
